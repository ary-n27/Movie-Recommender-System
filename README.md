Movie Recommender System
This project is a Movie Recommender System built using Streamlit, Pickle, and The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It suggests similar movies based on the user's selection and displays their posters.

Features
Recommends top 5 movies similar to the selected movie.
Displays movie posters alongside the recommendations.
Interactive dropdown for selecting movies.
Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system
Install Dependencies Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add TMDb API Key

Run the Application

bash

streamlit run app.py
File Structure
app.py - Main Streamlit app file.
movie_list.pkl - Preprocessed list of movies.
similarity.pkl - Precomputed similarity matrix.
requirements.txt - Python dependencies.
How It Works
Dataset
The movies and similarity data are loaded from pre-saved pickle files.

Recommendation

Select a movie from the dropdown.
The app uses a precomputed similarity matrix to find the most similar movies.
Poster Fetching
Movie posters are fetched dynamically using the TMDb API.

API Integration
The application uses the TMDb API to fetch movie posters. Ensure you have a valid API key and replace it in the fetch_poster() function:

python
Copy code
url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&language=en-US".format(movie_id)
Requirements
Python 3.7 or above
Libraries: streamlit, pickle, requests
Install these using:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Future Improvements
Add user authentication for personalized recommendations.
Use a larger and updated movie dataset.
Enhance UI/UX with additional filters and styling.
